_Modular and extensible 3D/2D Open Source Game Engine_

Welcome to the repository of my Personal 2D/3D which I build within my own spare time. 
The engine is designed to take advantage of modern technologies, taking advantage of multi-cores 
of modern CPUs, modern graphics APIs such as OpenGL Core and Vulkan, and portability whilst primarily 
supporting Windows/Linux/macOS platforms. (This engine should be similar to Doom 1, where it can run 
anywhere).

## Project Goals
- Full extensibility by the user
- Multi-processor support
- Swappable engine components (e.g. Easily swap physics/audio engines)

## Features
- Support for Windows/Linux/macOS platform builds for both game builds and the editor (Not-Implemented)
- OpenGL Core Rendering Back-end (Not-Implemented)
- Vulkan Rendering back-end (Not-Implemented)
- PhysX physics engine back-end (Not-Implemented)
- Fully Extensible editor, similar to the Unity3D engine (Not-Implemented)
- C++ Game code
- Editor similar to Unity3D/Unreal Engine 4 editor (Not-Implemented)
- Swappable engine back-ends (Not-Implemented)
- Portability where possible, allowing for cross-platform support

### Building
- CMake version >= 3.0
- C++11 Compiler (Currently tested with Visual Studio 2019)

### License
