**Modular and extensible 3D/2D Open Source Game Engine**

Welcome to the repository of my Personal 2D/3D which I build within my own spare time. 
The engine is designed to take advantage of modern technologies, taking advantage of multi-cores 
of modern CPUs, modern graphics APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan, and portability whilst primarily 
supporting Windows/Linux/macOS platforms. (This engine should be similar to Doom 1, where it can run 
anywhere).

## Features
- Support for Windows/Linux/macOS platform builds for both game builds and the editor (Not-Implemented)
- OpenGL 4.6 Rendering Back-end (Not-Implemented)
- Vulkan Rendering back-end (Not-Implemented)
- PhysX physics engine back-end (Not-Implemented)
- Extensible editor, similar to the Unity3D engine (Not-Implemented)
- C++ Game code (Not-Implemented)
- Project editor similar to Unity3D/Unreal Engine 4 editor (Not-Implemented)
- Swappable engine back-ends (Not-Implemented)
- Portability where possible, allowing for cross-platform support

## Project Goals
- Full extensibility by the user
- Multi-processor support
- Plug and play engine components (e.g. Easily swap physics/audio engines)
